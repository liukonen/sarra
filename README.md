# sarra
simple AI (think current terms Alexa) that I wrote many years ago (around 2006ish). (kind of a over glorified alarm clock)

# Reasion
Project started as such... a Good morning voice app. It morfied to read latest headlines, calendar events, weather and even my emails.
The original verison was in VB 6 and used MS agents. A seperate version was written as a voice controled music player, which would find 
your local music, and you'd press a key combination, to have it listen. I had a copy of this on my resume Floppy disks my junior year
college. Back in the AIM days, I even found a AIM client that I wraped this around to message a chat bot,
so you could talk to the PC, and it would instantly talk back.

# Source
Project was rewriten over the years, but I never got around to having a language the app could use (think pre created scripts
that could pull online content and could be shared / used... ) but I never got around to a final product of any kind. So I released
the sripted base source to Codeplex and now github.
